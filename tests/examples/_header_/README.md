# Knowledge-as-code
 
Terraform is an ideal knowledge transfer tool that can communicate the minutea of using certain technology combinations. We use this at [Futurice](https://futurice.com?source=terraform-examples) to disseminate hard won learnings across projects and industries, increasing the development velocity for all of our clients.

# Contribution
 
External contributions welcome! All that we ask is that the recipe is interesting, and that it worked at some point. There is no expectation of maintenance (maintained projects should probably have their own repository). No two projects are alike, and so, we expect most uses of this repository to require customization.
 
To regenerate the readme, run `npm run readme`
